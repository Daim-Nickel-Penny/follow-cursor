# Follow-Cursor

**Description**: This is a React Context API and React hooks-based interactive javascript cursor. The cursor replaces the standard cursor icon with a SVG circle which changes as per the hover or click action.

## Dependencies

"react": "^17.0.2",

"react-dom": "^17.0.2",

"react-scripts": "5.0.0",

## How to test the Project

1. Fork the project.

2. Open the folder in your editor. In terminal, copy and run

   `git clone https://github.com/Daim-Nickel-Penny/follow-cursor.git`

3. Open the follow-cursor folder in the editor. Run `npm install`

4. Once the npm libraries are installed. Run `npm start`

5. _Voila!_

## Future Prospect

I am planning to convert this into a reusable NPM package that can be installed in any react project. Also, the cursor component will be designed as a reusable component for passing style props. This will get the power to customize the looks of the cursor and also control the hover animations.
